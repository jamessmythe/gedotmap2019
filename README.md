#### Background

In 2017 [Paul Campbell](https://github.com/PaulC91) at [Culture of Insight](https:://www.cultureofinsight.com) wanted to build a different kind of electorate map that could provide a better visual representation of voter density and diversity at a single glance. For 2019, we have updated this with the new and fast [mapdeck package](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck) from SymbolixAU.


#### Process

The app was built with R, utilising mapdeck and Shiny, building on Paul's data prep code from 2017. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/jamessmythe/gedotmap2019)

Voter numbers for each constituency are divided by 250. The resulting number of dots are then randomly distributed within the constituency boundaries, colour-coded by party.
